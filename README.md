   ## Conclusions and Recommendations
   ***
   Based on the findings from the report above, the followings are recommended;
   1. More funds should be allocated for end of life care,as this will cater for the needs of the increasing number of old ages 
      and retirees in the nearest future.
    
   2. Railway Station(train) should be created as an alternative means of transportation, as this will reduce pressure on the 
      road. In addition,it will also reduce unemployment in the community through creation of jobs such as ;
      
      * train operator,
      * train cook,
      * train yard manager,
      * ticket seller,
      * train mechanic,
      * Dispatcher,
      * train conductor etc.

  * *__NOTE: Railway is recommended because there are no evidence of waterways in the community.__*

   The image above depicts the joyous mood of the residents of the community after the stakeholders have implemented what was 
   recommended, which is having a great impact on the youth, thereby decreasing unemployment in the community to about 1.5% of 
   the total Population(123 residents).
